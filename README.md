This repository serves a tentatively mission to note useful literatures/Apps/resources using in my researches about Ecology and Evolutionary Biology.  

## Statistics

### General topics
- [R package: performance](https://easystats.github.io/performance/index.html)  
    - A component of easystats-verse.
    - A all-in-one package that could help evaluate your model.

### Bayesian statistics
- [Podcast: Learning Bayesian Statistics](https://learnbayesstats.com/)
    - A podcast show that I frequently listen to during my jogging.  
    - I also benefit from it in learning English speaking and listening.  

- [Think Bayes 2nd edition](https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-bayes/)
    - I met this book while jogging and at the same time listening the podcast-Learning Bayesian Statistics. This book is a great self-study resource for people who want to learn bayesian statistics.  

### GEEs (Generalized estimating equations)
- [A good discussion on Researchgate about the difference between GEEs and GLMMs](https://www.researchgate.net/post/When_do_you_apply_GLMM_vs_GEE)  

### GLMMs (Generalized linear mixed models)
- [Review paper: Generalized linear mixed models: a practical guide for ecology and evolution](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0169534709000196)  
- [R package: visreg](https://pbreheny.github.io/visreg/index.html)  
    - Useful package to visualize the results of GLMMs.  
    - Some useful discussion on this package:
        - [The difference between the conditional plot and the contrast plot.](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/520774/questions-concerning-visualizing-model-results-with-the-r-package-visreg?newreg=01ebcc3086574df3bc45ecf94685129b)
- [Introduction of mixed models with R](https://m-clark.github.io/mixed-models-with-R/)  
- [Mixed Models for Agriculture in R](https://schmidtpaul.github.io/MMFAIR/)
- [Book: Mixed effects models and extensions in ecology with R](https://rd.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-0-387-87458-6?page=1#toc)
    - This book contains the introduction and also several examples for the use of analysis. The best thing for me is they include what you should write in your paper.  
- [R package: emmeans](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/emmeans/index.html)
    - Some discussion about the t.test method in pairs().
        - [1](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/369619/how-are-the-degrees-of-freedom-in-the-emmeans-package-calculated-r)
        - [2](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/487929/default-pairwise-test-in-emmeans)

- [Book: Data analysis using regression and multilevel/hierarchical models](https://books.google.com.tw/books?hl=zh-TW&lr=&id=c9xLKzZWoZ4C&oi=fnd&pg=PR17&dq=Gelmen+2007+hierarchical+regression&ots=bcR7P3Rtlg&sig=ACk0iGPIQS0T7MxeXDiOnWACiy4&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=Gelmen%202007%20hierarchical%20regression&f=false)
    - A clear book about the multilevel reality of GLMMs. Worth reading!   
    - The corresponding [R package: arm](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/arm/index.html).
