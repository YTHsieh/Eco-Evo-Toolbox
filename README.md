This repository serves a tentatively mission to note useful literatures/Apps/resources using in my researches.  

## Statistics

### Bayesian statistics
### GLMMs (Generalized linear mixed models)
- [Review paper: Generalized linear mixed models: a practical guide for ecology and evolution](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0169534709000196)  
- [R package: visreg](https://pbreheny.github.io/visreg/index.html)  
    - Useful package to visualize the results of GLMMs.  
- [Introduction of mixed models with R](https://m-clark.github.io/mixed-models-with-R/)
- [Book: Mixed effects models and extensions in ecology with R](https://rd.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-0-387-87458-6?page=1#toc)
    - This book contains the introduction and also several examples for the use of analysis. The best thing for me is they include what you should write in your paper.
